**Purpose:** Maintain Quality Throughout Meetups

To ensure the highest quality for each presentation at our meetups, we have established the following guidelines. These key elements describe the standards expected for presentations at DevOps Sk책ne. If other parties wish to host a meetup within our group or present at one, the tasks described below must be approved by at least one of the DevOps Sk책ne organizers.

1. Quality and subject of the presentations.
    - Maximum time is agreed with organizers. Keep the time. Really, keep the time.
    - No selling from the stage (no commercial subjects, no promotion for products, no advertisement as main subject for presentation).
    - Some Presentations or Talks can include Sales, Not forcing Members to use, just giving awareness of enterprise solutions.
    - Have a demo of product/solution from presentation, pre-created video demos are not acceptable unless one of the organizers approves it.
    - Speaker should be available after talk another 45 minutes to be able to answer questions from the crowd in the venue.
    - Make sure all material is be provided before or after the meetup (slides, Git repositories, etc) to all members of Devops Sk책ne (can be shared via organizers).
1. Quality of demo and slides.
    - You are allowed to use any tools to present slides and to do the demo.
    - Paid solutions (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) may be used only when demonstrating a product or solution.
    - Do not pressure meetup members to use any paid solutions.
    - Only include your company logo and the logo of the product being presented on your slides.
    - Fun pictures, GIFs, and screenshots are welcome. However, do not include content that could be described as pornography or that violates copyright laws.
    - Design your presentation to be accessible to all attendees, using readable fonts, high-contrast slides, and descriptive visuals.
1. Quality of meetup.
    - To foster open discussions, use phrases like *"my experience is..."* rather than *"this is the way it is"*.
    - Remember that everyone has valuable opinions, and each person is unique.
    - It's okay not to know everything.
    - Be honest, inclusive, and respectful in all interactions.
    - Show respect to everyone, regardless of nationality, religion, culture, gender, etc.
    - English is the primary language for communication, presentations, slides, and information.
