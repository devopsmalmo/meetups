## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Tuesday, 01 October 2019

**Topic:** 101 Docker Monitoring in Kubernetes

**Abstract:**
In modern times almost every application is running in Docker, by having such complex solutions to orchestrate Docker,
monitoring becomes more complex and near to unsolvable tackle. Let's brake this steriotipe and get some easy Monitoring tools
and Monitor our Docker Kubernetes solution with Prometheus. In Presentation we are going to cover how to monitor Docker 
in Kubernetes and how to get notified (in Slack) when something goes wrong.
