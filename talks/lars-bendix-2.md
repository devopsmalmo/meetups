**Topic:** Introducing SCM to a young, agile start-up

**Abstract:**<br/>
Most DevOps/Agile people have never heard about Software Configuration Management (SCM). Those who have consider SCM to be either a bureaucratic obstacle or a superfluous task. After all isn't DevOps/Agile a complete development method and it doesn't (explicitly) mention SCM. That couldn't be more mistaken. All projects need to apply SCM concepts and principles to avoid that a certain amount of chaos reigns. Outside the software world it is common practise to use configuration management. For many aspects software projects are no different from non-software projects. In this Meetup, I would like to take things to the extreme and put forward my view on what, when and how to introduce SCM in a young, agile start-up. Just about the most informal, light-weight and fast-paced setup one could imagine. In the Q&A part,

I would like to discuss to what degree my ideas align with the experience of real-life DevOps practitioners.

Even if your company is not a young, agile start-up maybe your needs (the what) and your priorities (the when) could/should be the same, though the implementation (the how) will probably differ.
