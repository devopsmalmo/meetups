## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Wednesday 4th May 2022

**Topic:** Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters with Terraform and ArgoCD

**Abstract:**<br/>
Why have a single monolithic Kubernetes cluster when you can have many? This does add complexity and overhead.
This talk will go through how Terraform can be used to provision infra, and ArgoCD used to provision the Kubernetes clusters into their "ready" state and beyond.
And of course, everything as code, in Git.
As a bonus, I will talk briefly about [Terraplate](https://github.com/verifa/terraplate): a simple CLI tool I authored to keep Terraform DRY.

**Bio:**<br/>
Jacob Lärfors.
CEO and Consultant at Verifa.

I like to help teams with Continuous Delivery and Cloud. Currently I spend most of my days in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), ArgoCD and Terraform.
