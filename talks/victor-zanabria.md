## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Tuesday, 19 November 2019

**Topic:** Kubernetes Architecture for Beginners

**Abstract:**
Kubernetes (k8s) is the most popular container orchestration system without a doubt. Every day tons of new k8s clusters are created and new k8s practitioners are born. Unfortunately, the excitement of getting straight to the practice usually comes together with a lack of a clear understanding of the k8s architecture, which is very helpful at the begining of any kubernetes implementation project.
In this presentation I am going to explain the main components of kubernetes, their roles and how they interact with each other.
No previous knowledge of k8s is required but it is recommended that the audience have a basic understanding of containers.
