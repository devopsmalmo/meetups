## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Wednesday, 08 February 2023

**Topic:** Get started with HashiCorp Vault

**Abstract:**
HashiCorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system.
A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API encryption keys, passwords, and certificates.
I will walk you through how to set up the vault dev environment, and speak about topics like
* Use Cases
* Interacting with Vault Policies
* Managing Vault Tokens
* Authentication, Authorization, and Identity with Vault
* Vault UI

The presentation will be a combination of slides and demos, to make sure we also get hands-on experience with HashiCorp Vault.
