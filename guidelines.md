   (Updated October 2018, October 2019)

**Purpose:** Maintain Quality Throughout Meetups

For each presentation, guidelines are needed to maintain the highest quality available. In this document key elements are described on the quality of a presentation in a meetup. To also involve other parties either by letting them host a meetup in our meetup or letting them speak (presentation), below described tasks should be approved by at least one of the organizers Devops Malmö.

1. Quality and subject of the presentations.
    - During COVID-19, only remote presentations are an option.
    - Check the subject/presentation in advance by Devops Malmö organizers.
    - Maximum time is agreed with organizers. Keep the time. Really, keep the time.
    - No selling from the stage (no commercial subjects, no promotion for products, no advertisement as main subject for presentation).
    - Some Presentations or Talks can include Sales, Not forcing Members to use, just giving awareness of enterprise solutions. 
    - Have a demo of product/solution from presentation, pre-created video demos are not acceptable unless one of the organizers approves it.
    - Speaker should be available after talk another 45 minutes to be able to answer questions from the crowd in the venue.

1. Quality of meetup.
    - To open up for discussions, it’s good to say things like _“my experience is”_ rather than _“this is the way it is”_.
    - Remember that everyone has a valuable opinion and every one is unique.
    - It’s okay not to know everything.
    - Be honest, inclusive, and respectful.
