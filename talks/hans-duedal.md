## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: TBD, 01 TBD 20xx

**Topic:** Istio In Production

**Abstract:**
War-stories from an eventually successful Istio production rollout, for machine
learning workloads in the cloud. 
We'll start by examining managed Istio, in particular GKEs "built-in" Istio,
then deep dive on the traditional helm-deployed Istio. We'll see how added
istio features like Kiali provides visibility into the smart plumbing of your
services, and how we can use it, and other tools, to debug when things doesn't
work (like you expected). We'll conclude with reflecting on how to best add a
service mesh to your stack.
