For each presentation, guidelines are needed in order to maintain the highest quality available. In this document key elements are described on the quality of a presentation in a meetup. In order to also involve other parties either by letting them host a meetup in our meetup or letting them speak (presentation), below described tasks should be approved by at least one of organizers Devops Malmö.

    - Check the subject/presentation in advance by Devops Malmö organizers.
    - Maximum time is agreed with organizers. Keep the time. Really, keep the time.
    - No selling from stage (no commercial subjects, no promotion for products, no advertisement)
    - Have a demo of product/solution (video demos are not accepted).
    - If presentation doesn't contain real demo, presentation should be approved by at least two organizers.
