## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Thursday, 20 January 2022

**Topic:** Introducing rule-based refactoring

**Abstract:**<br/>
Senior devs commonly rely on “code smells” to determine what to refactor. However, code smells are difficult to master, especially for juniors. I present a cognitive-light approach to code quality focusing on quantifiable rules, which allows devs to make tangible improvements to their code today!

**Bio:**<br/>
Christian Clausen works as a Technical Agile Coach teaching teams how to properly refactor their code. Previously he worked as a software engineer on the Coccinelle semantic patching project, an automated refactoring tool. He has an MSc in computer science and five years’ experience teaching software quality at a university level. He is the author of the book Five Lines of Code published by Manning.
