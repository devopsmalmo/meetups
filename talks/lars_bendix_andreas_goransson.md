## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Tuesday, 7 March 2023

**Topic:** The full story of Software Bill of Materials (SBoM)

**Abstract:**<br/>
Why should DevOps practitioners be interested in Software Bill of
Materials (SBoM)? Firstly, being responsible for “producing things”
(binaries and executables) DevOps has immediate access, at the time when
it is created, to the data that is needed for constructing an SBoM for a
binary or executable, which makes it a lot easier and faster to
construct and its data more consistent. Secondly, the use of an SBoM is
not limited to searching for vulnerabilities. It has many other use
cases that are very useful during the development and maintenance of a
product. So DevOps will not only be “producers” of SBoMs, but can also
be very active “consumers” of SBoMs in their daily work.

The American NTIA has worked hard to make SBoMs a legal requirement for
delivering software to the American government - and other sectors may
follow in the future. The NTIA has been very focused on cybersecurity
and sees an SBoM as “a list of ingredients used for vulnerability scan”.
Even if this is an important use case, an SBoM is much more than just a
list of ingredients and the range of use cases for an SBoM is much wider
than a simple scan for vulnerabilities. The concept of SBoM also has a
much longer and varied history than recent security incidents.

In this talk, we present and motivate a number of the 10 overarching use
case categories (of which “vulnerability scan” is only one) that we have
distilled from an extensive literature study and numerous interviews
with practitioners. Furthermore, we sketch the requirements that are
needed for implementing a selected set of these use case categories.
Finally, we list a number of general, cross-cutting considerations that
you should take into account if you want the operation of SBoMs to be
smooth and powerful.

With this knowledge DevOps practitioners will be able to utilise and
exploit the concept of SBoM to its full potential and provide better
service and support for development teams and organisations.
